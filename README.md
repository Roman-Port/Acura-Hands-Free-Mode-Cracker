# Acura Hands-Free-Mode Cracker

Software designed for an Arduino to crack the four digit pin code on early 2000s Acura hands free mode systems.

## Why?
tl;dr; neither the previous owner or I know the pin code to the hands free system in this Acura. I'd like to get it working, but it's locked behind this code.
